# Introduction to Digital Image Compression

## What is Image Compression?
Image compression is the process of reducing the file size of an image without losing too much on its quality. By reducing the file size, images can be transmitted or stored more efficiently. There are two main types of image compression: **lossless** and **lossy**.

- **Lossless compression**: Reduces file size without any loss of image quality. The original image can be perfectly retained from the compressed data.
- **Lossy compression**: Reduces file size by removing some image data, leading to a small loss in quality. However, the reduction in size is usually much greater than with lossless compression.

## Why is Image Compression Important?
- **Storage Space**: Image files can be large. Compressing them saves storage space, especially on devices with small capacity.
- **Faster Loading**: Compressed images load faster, improving user experience on websites and mobile apps.
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Smaller file sizes mean less data transfer, which is beneficial for web pages or applications with many images.
