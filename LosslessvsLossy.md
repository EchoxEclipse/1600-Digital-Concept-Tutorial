# Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

## Lossless Compression
Lossless compression holds every detail of the original image. After decompression, the image is identical to the original. Popular lossless format examples:
- **PNG**: Often used for images that need to keep transparency.
- **GIF**: Used for simple images with limited colors, like logos or animations.

### Examples of Lossless Compression Algorithms:
- **ZIP**
- **LZ77**

## Lossy Compression
Lossy compression loses some image quality to achieve a higher compression ratio. This is most effective for photographs or complex images. Popular lossy format examples:
- **JPEG**: More used for photographs and web images. JPEG allows adjusting the compression level for a balance between quality and file size.
- **WebP**: A format developed by Google that supports both lossless and lossy compression.

### Examples of Lossy Compression Algorithms:
- **JPEG compression**
- **WebP compression**
