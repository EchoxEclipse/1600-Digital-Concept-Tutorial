# Popular Image Compression Formats

## JPEG
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is one of the most used lossy formats. It works by discarding image details that are less noticeable, allowing for smaller file sizes. It is widely used for photographs and web images.

## PNG
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a lossless format that uses more complex methods to compress images without losing quality. It is great for images that require transparency and images with sharp edges, like logos and illustrations.

## GIF
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) supports simple animations and images with a small color palette. It is lossless but only supports up to 256 colors.

## WebP
WebP is a format developed by Google that supports both lossy and lossless compression. It provides better compression and image quality compared to JPEG and PNG.
